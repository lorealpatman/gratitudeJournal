# simpleApp

This is a Gratitude Journal App that I'm currently working on. You can add Gratitude Entries and they render on the page. My next step is to add additional features. Considering a login feature but the main idea is a community gratitude journal. I think it's important for people to know what other people are grateful for.

Web Scraper is used to render a different gratitude quote (from external site), on the landing page,  per page load.
